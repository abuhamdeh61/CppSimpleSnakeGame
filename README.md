# Snake Game

This is a simple console-based Snake Game implemented in C++. You control a snake that moves around the screen, eating fruit to grow longer. The objective is to grow as long as possible without colliding with the walls or yourself.

## Instructions

- Move the snake using the following keys:
  - `a`: Move left
  - `d`: Move right
  - `w`: Move up
  - `s`: Move down
- `p`: Pause the game
- `x`: End the game

## Gameplay

- The snake starts with a single segment.
- As you collect fruit, the snake grows longer.
- The game ends if the snake collides with the walls or itself.

## How to Play

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Compile the code using a C++ compiler (e.g., g++).
3. Run the executable.
4. Use the `a`, `s`, `d`, and `w` keys to control the snake's direction.
5. Press `p` to pause the game.
6. Press `x` to end the game.
7. Try to eat as much fruit as possible without colliding with the walls or yourself.

## Implementation Details

- The game logic is implemented using classes and structures.
- The snake's position and length are tracked.
- Fruit is randomly placed on the screen for the snake to eat.
- The game checks for collisions with walls and the snake's body.
- The game loop updates the screen and handles user input.

Have fun playing the Snake Game!
